                        An internet based on quantum physics will soon enable inherently secure communication. A team led by Stephanie Wehner, at Delft University of Technology, is building a network connecting four cities in the Netherlands entirely by means of quantum technology. Messages sent over this network will be unhackable.
                        In the last few years, scientists have learned to transmit pairs of photons across fiber-optic cables in a way that absolutely protects the information encoded in them. A team in China used a form of the technology to construct a 2,000-kilometer network backbone between Beijing and Shanghai—but that project relies partly on classical components that periodically break the quantum link before establishing a new one, introducing the risk of hacking.
                        The Delft network, in contrast, will be the first to transmit information between cities using quantum techniques from end to end.
                        The technology relies on a quantum behavior of atomic particles called entanglement. Entangled photons can’t be covertly read without disrupting their content.
                        But entangled particles are difficult to create, and harder still to transmit over long distances. Wehner’s team has demonstrated it can send them more than 1.5 kilometers (0.93 miles), and they are confident they can set up a quantum link between Delft and the Hague by around the end of this year. Ensuring an unbroken connection over greater distances will require quantum repeaters that extend the network.                        
                        Such repeaters are currently in design at Delft and elsewhere. The first should be completed in the next five to six years, says Wehner, with a global quantum network following by the end of the decade.

                <h1 class="text-justify font-xs">Edge Computing vs Cloud Computing</h1>
                <h4 class="text-justify font-xs">Real-time performance is one of the main reasons for using an edge computing architecture, but not the only one. Edge computing can also help prevent overloading network backbones by processing more data locally and sending to the cloud only data that needs to go to the cloud. There could also be security, privacy, and data sovereignty advantages to keeping more data close to the source rather than shipping it to a centralized location.
                    There are plenty of challenges ahead for edge computing, however. A recent Gartner report, How to Overcome Four Major Challenges in Edge Computing, suggests “through 2022, 50 percent of edge computing solutions that worked as proofs of concept (POCs) will fail to scale for production use.” Those who pursue the promise of edge computing need to be prepared to tackle all the usual issues associated with technologies that still need to prove themselves – best practices for edge system management, governance, integration, and so on have yet to be defined.
                    The edge and the cloud coexist
                    No one is going to abandon the cloud in favor of the edge. As the FCC white paper puts it, “Many industry experts are pushing back on the notion that cloud and edge computing are in competition with each other. Instead, forward-looking organizations, and even many public cloud service providers, are beginning to consider how to selectively employ both.”
                    In other words, functions best handled by the computing split between the end device and local network resources will be done at the edge, while big data applications that benefit from aggregating data from everywhere and running it through analytics and machine learning algorithms running economically in hyperscale data centers will stay in the cloud. And the system architects who learn to use all these options to the best advantage of the overall system will be heroes.
                    “I think it’s going to be very rare that an application will live only in edge computing,” Adib says. “It’s going to need to communicate and interact with other workloads that are in the cloud or in an enterprise data center or on another device.”

            <h4 class="text-justify font-xs">
                What does the future of web development look like? That is believed by many that next year bots will become more self-learning and will easily match particular user’s needs and behavior. That means that 24/7-operating bots will be able to replace support managers and save costs for many companies. 
                In the upcoming decade, chatbots will remain the most common instruments to serve people and become the major branch of digital development.
                Huge B2C companies already use the technology to serve their customers — official page chatbots inside Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, and Skype are good examples. A bot could be also integrated into PWA, regular website, professional or household equipment, and any Internet-connected app developed by a commercial company. 
                Bot’s rise will also influence trends in web design, especially UX one. The significant advanced of AI and machine learning technology resulted in demand for virtual assistant designs, which is not only about visual experience, or product serving algorithms, but also about useful sound design.
                The most important advantages of AI-based bots are 24/7 problem-solving potential, human-like experience, and deep consumer behavior analytics.

  <h1 class="text-justify font-xs">Flutter web version</h1>
    <h4 class="text-justify font-xs">Flutter’s web support delivers the same experiences on the web as on 
        mobile. Building on the portability of Dart, the power of the web platform
        and the flexibility of the Flutter framework, you can now build apps for iOS, Android, and the browser from the same codebase. You can compile existing Flutter code written in Dart into a web experience because it is exactly the same Flutter framework and web is just another device target for your app.
        Adding web support to Flutter involved implementing Flutter’s core drawing layer on top of standard browser APIs, in addition to compiling Dart to JavaScript, instead of the ARM machine code that is used for mobile applications. Using a combination of DOM, Canvas, and WebAssembly, Flutter can provide a portable, high-quality, and performant user experience across modern browsers. We implemented the core drawing layer completely in Dart and used Dart’s optimized JavaScript compiler to compile the Flutter core and framework along with your application into a single, minified source file that can be deployed to any web server.
    While you can do a lot on the web, Flutter’s web support is most valuable in the following scenarios:
    A Progressive Web Application built with Flutter
    Flutter delivers high-quality PWAs that are integrated with a user’s environment, including installation, offline support, and tailored UX.
    Single Page Application
    Flutter’s web support enables complex standalone web apps that are rich with graphics and interactive content to reach end users on a wide variety of devices.
    Existing mobile applications
    Web support for Flutter provides a browser-based delivery model for existing Flutter mobile apps.
    Not every HTML scenario is ideally suited for Flutter at this time.
    For example, text-rich, flow-based, static content such as blog articles 
    benefit from the document-centric model that the web is built around, 
    rather than the app-centric services that a UI framework like Flutter 
    can deliver. However, you can use Flutter to embed interactive experiences 
    into these websites.
